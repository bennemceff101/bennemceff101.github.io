									<h2><a href="#">Executive Metrics Dashboard<br />
									</a></h2>
									<section>
									<p style = "text-align:left;">
									Scenario: We need to provide VPs with a quick and easy layout to view summary statistics for our company.
		  							<br>	
									<br>	
		  							Where's the Data? We use OneStream to build and mantain annual budgets. OneStream also will provide reporting
									on actuals. We already had this in Excel QuickViews and CubeViews via the OneStream add-in, but in formats best for creating the company reporting PDFs & PPTs.
									So why not create a more Tableau Friendly Quick View via the OneStream connector?
									<br>
									<br>
									Step 1: Created a basic Quick View via the OneStream Excel add-in.  Org ID and portfolio were key components on rows, 
									time was a big component on columns. We won't get into the weeds, yet I will mention one metric is reported on a period end (4-week basis) while another is bi-weekly (2-week basis)
									<br>
									<br>
									Step 2: A quick org info lookup table was created in Excel to add org names to org ids. Now names could have been brought into the QuickView, yet I wanted to ensure I used
									Organization IDs, not names as a general practice. It is thought in the long run, names won't be part of the dataset, they will simply be a joined table in Tableau.
									<br>
									<br>
									Step 3: Tableau Prep was used to pivot the data to make it even flatter for Tableau Desktop. The Prep flow was published
									to Tableau Server as a datasource. This will require a refresh every 4 weeks, yet in the long term, an automated, scheduled
									data job could run, if wes Tableau's Data Management package. It required 2 pivots to flatten the data, and I imagine it could be simpler.
									Additionally, I joined the metrics data with our fiscal calendar, to be on the safe side, but found Tableau did just fine w/o it. 
									A future version will remove this extra table/join/output.  Output2 is the good one.
									<br>
									<br>
									Step 4: To make fake data to dsiplay this on Tableau Public, I created a copy of this Tableau Prep file and added a "Multiplier" column along with calculated fields
									applying this to actuals and budgets. The "Org Name" column is the other fake column.
									<br>
									<br>
									Step 5: Worksheets were created in Tableau Desktop. One division (GGGG in the fake data) has an alternate project hierarchy
									in OneStream to report on a different customer, so a popup window was created to appear in the header dashboard header if selected. A filter formula T/F was made to 
									control its display
									<br>
									<br>
									Step 5: URL links with images were created to our company standard reports in PDF & PPT, and a Tutorial MP4 was made. These
									files are all housed on Microsoft SharePoint.
									<br>
									<br>
									Step 6: A dynamic "Executive Summary" worksheet was created to sit in the bottom right corner. The caption is used here 
									to display a written summary. Tableau Data Story was attempted but gave clumsy details. A more manual "curation"
									 of that written summary was required for now.
